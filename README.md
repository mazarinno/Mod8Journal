I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure using unit testing for each class or object within my code. I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by taking into consideration all of what the user asks for and also anticipating necessities that may not have been expressly mentioned.  I approach designing software first as a blueprint, then as a working implementation that can always be improved.
